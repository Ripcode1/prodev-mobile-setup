## Creating Placeholder Images

If you don't have images ready, you can create simple placeholders:

### Option 1: Use an online tool
- Visit https://placeholder.com/
- Create a 200x60 image for Logo.png
- Create a 1080x1920 image for background-image.png

### Option 2: Use design tools
- Use Canva, Figma, or Photoshop
- Create images with the recommended dimensions
- Export as PNG

### Option 3: Use free stock images
- Visit https://unsplash.com/ or https://pexels.com/
- Search for "real estate" or "property" for background
- Search for "logo" for the logo image
- Download and rename appropriately

## Note
The auto-checker is looking for these specific files:
- `assets/images/Logo.png`
- `assets/images/background-image.png`

Make sure the file names match exactly (including case)!
